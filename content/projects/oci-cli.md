# Abstract
This project was purely meant as a fun project to gain more experiance in Golang as well as using the SDKs for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure(OCI). OCI already has a cli built in python so I decided to rebuild it in golang. This would showcase how easy it is to install the oci without any dependecies. I also planned to add some features some technical solutions engineers might find helpful, for instance getting the ip address of a compute instance in one command instead of 3.

# Challenges I Faced
- learning how to use the [spf13/cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) library
- learning how to use the [oci-go-sdk](https://github.com/oracle/oci-go-sdk) to create, update, and delete resources in OCI
- learning how to implement bash completion
