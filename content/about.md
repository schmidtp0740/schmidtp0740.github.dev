I have a passion for dev and ops. In my free time I like to work on side projects to create tools, either simple cli tools or web based ones. My career path is focused on being a customer facing developer creating tools to support cloud services. I create applications mainly for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and in my free time I dabble into GCP.  My two favorite techs are Golang and Docker, but I continually quest to learn new technologies, methodologies, and workflows.
