Hello! My name is Philip Schmidt. If I had to describe my skillset in one word I would say DevOps. The reason is because I have a background in development and ops. On the dev side, I have built cloud-native applications running on k8s and I love to build tools, either cli or web based. On the ops side, I have a background in networking like TCP/IP, DNS, IPSec VPN as I have helped enterprise customers assisted in configuring their cloud networks and IPSec VPN to the cloud. I also love to build tools to automate infrastructure deployments and configure them. With this background, I focus on being a customer facing developer helping build tools and cloud-native applications.
